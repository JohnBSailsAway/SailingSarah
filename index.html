        <p>
            I am a retired programmer trying to remember how Gitbub works.  Setting up a web page to play around with.  <img src="IMG_0229.JPG" alt="SV Sarah" width="400" height="600" />

        <h2>What I'm working on</h2>
        <p>
            I'm trying to get my sailboat SV Sarah ready for cruising. So I work on something all the time on the boat or for the boat.  I just finished installing a new auto pilot but still need to finish setting up the software for the install.
